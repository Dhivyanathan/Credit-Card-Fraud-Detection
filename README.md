# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions representing less than 1% of total records.  The goal is to build a classification model that prioritizes detecting fraud while managing false positives effectively.
